> [!todo] The Goal
> Build a **flexible & modular** system so that I can easily change up my days according to life's challenges while still progressing towards my goals

> Mastering the day starts with mastering the morning.

- morning routine sets the tone for the day
- morning routine begins the night before
- fill each daily stack with items from below plus any items from the [[Weekly Stack]] that belong in the day. for example, Sunday has some items built into phase 3 (place workout clothes)
- some days are modded during weekly planning [[Weekly Stack]]
  - Monday phase 1 bundles a run with lunch
- Break the day into three phases and slot routines/habits ("Stacks") into each phase

# Phase 1 (6:00 - 14:00) - Alert & Focused

> [!info]
> In the first 0-8 hours after waking, your brain and body better equiped for action and focus due to elevated levels of dopamine, adrenaline and cortisol. This makes it easier to overcome limbic friction.
>
> > [!tip]
> > We are also more prone to distraction and reflexive multitasking at this time. Don’t succumb to that.
>
> Set 1-4 habits for completion in Phase 1. These should be habits that require **energy** and **focus**.
>
> Setting a window for completion (e.g., 45 min of focused reading, work, etc. in Phase 1 rather than a precise start and stop time lends flexibility to your schedule. For example, you might elect to exercise or write or study “after waking but before noon,” meaning it can be done at 8 a.m., 10 a.m. or 11 a.m. but definitely in Phase 1. Of course, if you can do it at the same time each day, great, but setting a broader window of opportunity can help given busy lives.

# Phase 2 (15:00 - 21:00) - Creativity

> [!info]
>
> - 9 - 15 hours after waking, we have naturally higher levels of serotonin and lower levels of adrenaline. Leverage this by engaging in habits that don’t require you to overcome much limbic friction.
> - This is an excellent time for behaviors and thinking that can be completed with less focus. The sort that involves creative exploration is perfect: writing fiction, rough drafts, writing music, play of any kind, experimentation. Or lower-focus requirement physical pursuits like Zone 2 cardio. Whereas Phase 1 is terrific for habit where precise execution is needed, Phase 2 is best for looser things—trying a new recipe, brainstorming, exploring a new approach to some aspect of work, a physical pursuit, relationships or learning.
