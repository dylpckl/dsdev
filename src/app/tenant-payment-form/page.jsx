              is a web-based property management software tailored specifically
              for the NYC market. One key feature of the application (and major
              user task) is applying tenant payments to their open charges, the
              majority of which originate from monthly bills.

              This task can be completed by creating a batch of tenants

              Alternatively, users can choose to have SPIRE select the tenants
              automatically for them by analyzing monthly bills.

            Given the extremely tight 2 week deadline, and being the lone

            evolved quite a bit in accordance with user feedback. As such, my

            form, I opted to use a full page structure instead of a modal, which
            I prefer to use sparingly for urgent user tasks. The extra space
            this affords means that I can utilize a two-column layout and
            display some extra instructions to the user. Organization. After
            re-arranging form fields according to hierarchy, related fields are
            grouped together into rows to make the form more digestable for the
            user. Updated Controls. Several controls on the legacy modal are
            patterns that we no longer use on the website and as such some new
            patterns were adopted for this form. A button that previously opened
            another nested modal for multi-record selection becomes a Combobox
            (autocomplete) that displays results as badges inside the input
            (super slick but I cant take credit for it) A radio group takes the
            form of a Segmented Control which saves vertical space and looks
            much more polished, professional and exciting. This is also an
            opportunity to add interesting hover states. User Instructions.
            Taking advantage of the extra real estate we gained by opting for a
            two-column layout, we can add some details under the form steps to
            provide some clarity to the user so they can make informed & correct
            choices as they progress through the form.
