        I&apos;m Dylan, a UI designer & developer from Long Island, New York. In
        the summer of 2005 I snagged myself a copy of Photoshop CS and became
        obsessed with creating forum signatures. Designing for the web has been
        a big part of my life ever since.

        I&apos;m currently the lead UI/UX Designer for{" "}

          New York&apos;s premier property management software solution

        , where my focus is designing an enterprise application that&apos;s easy
        to use, nice to look at, and that gets out of the user&apos;s way.

        When I&apos;m not at my computer, I can usually be found hanging out
        with my wife & daughter, hiking in the mountains, or telling stories
        around a table with friends.
